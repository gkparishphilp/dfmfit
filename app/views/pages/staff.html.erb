          <h2>Dan Miller</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">  Dan Miller (CF Level 1, NASM, CPT, CF Oly, Nutrition, Mobility, SealFit Level 1) is CEO of DFM Fitness, LLC and founder of CrossFit 2120 in Del Mar, California. He provides personal training and group CrossFit training for both sport-specific objectives and general physical preparedness. Dan’s high standards are reflected in a safe, supportive, and clean gym environment and in a passion for helping athletes realize their potential.

            Dan was a competitive mogul skier back when neon was cool the first time. His drive to improve his performance, and to help others improve theirs, led to training and coaching. This journey brought him to CrossFit in 2005, when he became a certified coach. By 2007, Dan had become the head trainer at U.S. CrossFit in Encinitas, CA. In 2012, he opened CrossFit 2120, which grew to over 100 members in under a year. Dan also coaches SEALFIT Kokoro Camp, a 50-hour crucible training experience.

            Dan’s approach to training mixes tough-love and humor and has proved successful for local military, first responders, moms & dads, teen athletes, grandparents, college students, Olympians, and professional athletes. He takes great pride in the community’s camaraderie and dedication and knows that anyone with the courage to start and the persistence to continue will find improved health and a new love of fitness.

            Dan is originally from Michigan and is a die-hard Redwings fan. He lives with his wife Nikki (aka Squirrel), a physical therapist/biomechanics specialist and owner of Movement Performance San Diego, and their adorable daughter Scarlett (aka Munchie) in North County, San Diego. When not coaching, Dan can be found surfing, enjoying daddy-time with his daughters Scarlett and Andi, or manning the grill at a 2120 cookout.</p>

          <h2>Alan Anderson</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">My name is Alan Anderson, born and raised in San Diego, CA. For the first 18 years of my life I was an overweight individual, who lived everyday eating junk food and playing video games. Through high school I worked my way up to 274 lbs. and decided that I would no longer live my life this way. I than began my fitness journey; I found a personal trainer, poured money, time & commitment into it and within 8 months I had lost 91 lbs. (274-183lbs.)
I am a firm believer that anyone who has the right people around them and the right belief in self can accomplish anything. I was not born into this world fit and active, I had and continue to work on it everyday of my life. I understand the hardship, changes and challenges that have to be made in order to achieve your goals and dreams.
<br>
I have a few standards I require in every class from each athlete. I do not demand perfection but good hard work. My top priority in every class is safety. I have a strong passion for getting all athletes to move to the best of their ability, always striving to hit their true potential. It is my experience and belief that if you can constantly move well you will not only increase you athletic ability, you will also increase your ability to stay fit and ready for the rigors and unknowns of every day life. I am always looking for new ways to make class a learning experience, but more importantly I am always striving to make the class fun!

          <p class="lead mb-0">
I have always been active. I grew up doing gymnastics and figure skating. I later got certified as a personal trainer and started teaching bootcamps. I had a friend tell me about Crossfit, and I tried it and never want to leave this sport. I love the community and family aspect of it. I love strategizing my workouts and mentally pushing myself beyond what I ever thought that I could do. I love being strong and being around strong and likeminded people. Getting the opportunity to coach this sport that I love so much is amazing, and I am very grateful. I love when people say that they can’t do something because I will change it to something that they can do. I love building rapports with the members and really helping them move well, in addition to making them love where they come to work hard everyday.
<br>
I love weightlifting, but my speciality is more the gymnastics side. I love all the handstands and different variations, and all the muscle ups. When I’m not at the gym, I’m probably thinking about the gym, but I enjoy hiking and riding my bike around the beach, music, going out with friends, trying new food, and hanging with my dog. I enjoy being outside with good people and anywhere their is live music. I live to explore. It’ll be 4 years in March that I have been doing CrossFit and I wouldn’t change it for the world.
