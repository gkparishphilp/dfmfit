							<p>“Ready, ready!” <br>
              Dan Miller (CF Level 1, NASM, CPT, CF Oly, Nutrition, Mobility, SealFit Level 1) is CEO of DFM Fitness, LLC and founder of CrossFit 2120 in Del Mar, California. He provides personal training and group CrossFit training for both sport-specific objectives and general physical preparedness. Dan’s high standards are reflected in a safe, supportive, and clean gym environment and in a passion for helping athletes realize their potential.

              Dan was a competitive mogul skier back when neon was cool the first time. His drive to improve his performance, and to help others improve theirs, led to training and coaching. This journey brought him to CrossFit in 2005, when he became a certified coach. By 2007, Dan had become the head trainer at U.S. CrossFit in Encinitas, CA. In 2012, he opened CrossFit 2120, which grew to over 100 members in under a year. Dan also coaches SEALFIT Kokoro Camp, a 50-hour crucible training experience.

              Dan’s approach to training mixes tough-love and humor and has proved successful for local military, first responders, moms & dads, teen athletes, grandparents, college students, Olympians, and professional athletes. He takes great pride in the community’s camaraderie and dedication and knows that anyone with the courage to start and the persistence to continue will find improved health and a new love of fitness.

              Dan is originally from Michigan and is a die-hard Redwings fan. He lives with his wife Nikki (aka Squirrel), a physical therapist/biomechanics specialist and owner of Movement Performance San Diego, and their adorable daughter Scarlett (aka Munchie) in North County, San Diego. When not coaching, Dan can be found surfing, enjoying daddy-time with his daughters Scarlett and Andi, or manning the grill at a 2120 cookout.</p>
