About
Great Fitness in North County San Diego
CrossFit 2120 is exclusively located in coastal Del Mar, California. We are a unique training and workout facility nestled in the heart of the town, just two blocks from the Pacific Ocean and the Del Mar Fairgrounds. We are literally located – as Del Mar’s town motto says – “where the surf meets the turf.”

We have a 2,400 square foot main facility and a 600 square foot private training annex. Our world-class training center has some of the best running routes in all of North County San Diego. Our gym uses barbells, kettlebells, dumbbells, jump ropes, slam balls, medicine balls, squat racks, pull up racks, and lots of other equipment. We have great tools at our disposal to generate great movement and help our athletes reach their potential.
