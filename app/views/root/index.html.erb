           <h2>About us</h2>
           <p class="lead mb-5">CrossFit 2120 is exclusively located in coastal Del Mar, California. We are a unique training and workout facility nestled in the heart of the town, just two blocks from the Pacific Ocean and the Del Mar Fairgrounds. We are literally located – as Del Mar’s town motto says – “where the surf meets the turf.”<br>
            We have a 2,400 square foot main facility and a 600 square foot private training annex. Our world-class training center has some of the best running routes in all of North County San Diego. Our gym uses barbells, kettlebells, dumbbells, jump ropes, slam balls, medicine balls, squat racks, pull up racks, and lots of other equipment. We have great tools at our disposal to generate great movement and help our athletes reach their potential.</p>

           <h2>Why Crossfit 2120</h2>
           <p class="lead mb-5">Safety. Accountability. Fun. That’s what CrossFit 2120 stands for. I started this gym to share a vision of training and to bring out the best in people. CrossFit can be intimidating for new people. So, we have an optional on-ramp program that teaches safety and functional movements. An injured athlete isn’t coming back for more, we focus on mechanics before intensity. We believe in accountability. Accountability in movements guarantees safety. Accountability to programming guarantees results. At the end of each hour, a sense of team and accomplishment brings our members together. This camaraderie is the extra benefit from becoming a part of our 2120 family. After you’re done, you look better, you feel better, you ARE better. Come down to CrossFit 2120 and explore the possibilities. Coach Dan Miller.
